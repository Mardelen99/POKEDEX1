Pokedex Project
This Pokedex project was created as part of the Full-Stack Immersion course at CareerFoundry. The project demonstrates how to use a User Interface (UI) and API integration to retrieve and display Pokémon data. By connecting to the PokéAPI, the app allows users to select a Pokémon name and view its associated height and type.
Project Overview
The project fetches data from the https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150 , which provides detailed information about the first 150 Pokémon. Users can interact with the page by selecting a Pokémon from the list, and the app will dynamically display the height and type of the selected Pokémon.
Key Features:
Pokemon List: A dropdown or list of Pokémon names.
Details Display: When a user selects a Pokémon, its height and type are displayed.
API Integration: Fetching data from the PokéAPI to display accurate information in real time.
